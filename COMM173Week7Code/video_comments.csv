We had chicken for dinner, and used the rest through the weekend for sandwiches, salads or soup or casseroles, enchiladas, etc. Delicious and inexpensive."

Its definitely worth the price when you can stretch the flavor like that.

I remember pointing out to one of my co-workers how good they were, and this was when I worked in Totem Lake which was from 1993 to 2001."

This is when a store intentionally sells a product for less than what it costs them to put it on the shelf in order to attract customers who will usually buy something else while they're there. Grocery stores do this with milk."

I worked at Best Buy when the PlayStation 3 came out. I noticed we were actually selling them for a little less than what we were purchasing them for. Some of the computers too. Turns out the profit margins are so high on the accessories and games that they were willing to take a small loss if it meant another consumer to buy all of those extras.

One year my boss gave all his employees $100 gift card to Costco as part of our Christmas bonus. I used over half of my card to simply purchase the rotisserie whole chicken. My card lasted me into the start of summer. Their chicken tastes better than Sam's IMO.

They place the section in a section of the store that makes it clear you walk by as much items as possible, to entice potential additional purchases. And in Wincos case, they keep their prices low by requiring certain fried chicken sets (we add these drums and wings for example always at a specific ratio) and to minimize waste as well. They also sell their fried chicken cold for a often more expensive price. 
Just wanted to bring it up because I considered similar context, and also I know there's other viewers out there that go to Winco Foods that dont often consider that factor in the northwest."

I’m not sure how, but we can spend over $500 on one grocery trip to Costco.  I can’t imagine what we will spend there when our kids are all teenagers."

The reason why they sold the roasted chicken and cheap hot dogs was because of the long travel time for its customers.  Back when they started Costco's were sparse.  And sometimes you'd have to drive 45 minutes or more on the interstate. The cheap food sold at a loss was something for it's customers between the shopping and the long travel home.  The rotisserie chicken was also part of that idea.  A take away to be enjoyed at home for cheap.  Also, back in the early 90's, the chicken was 3.99."

This is the point at which the demand and supply curves in the market intersect, and it's also where profit is maximized. That's why it's not always better to raise prices or lower them."

Costco wants you to keep coming back and buying a freshly cooked chicken and just about everything else you see.  If you stock up on uncooked chicken, it's unlikely you'll be back in multiple times for other items."

Love costco, but that’s why the chicken and hot dogs stay so cheap."

You get in for 2 or 3 essentials and gtfo. Who is it, on a busy Monday evening, that is asking the name of the chicken farmer? y'all do that??  You can always tell who just joined because they have a heaping cart of random and look terrified at the checkout."

Sad part is you HAVE to throw about 30-40% of them away once the store closes. I worked in the chicken dept at Costco for a couple months and had to throw perfectly edible chickens away each night bc they didn’t sell.

It tasted incredible and makes our chickens taste like saw dust. Of course it was very expensive and I found out that the whole poulet de Brest chicken in a store cost $30.00.

IMHO, they also taste better. The down side is that BJ's is absolutely horrible at having them available. I have gone there when there were none left, and they told me it will be 2.5 hours until new ones are ready. They seem to have no concept of thinking ahead, they wait until they run out, then put new ones in the rotisserie."

It's what they call a ""loss leader"", and all big stores do it.  For some stores it's soda.  Others it's bottled water.  It can be different products at different times.

Costco's loss leader happens to be chickens."

Lol. BUT when I was hired at COSTCO in October of 2004 I actually worked in the Deli and I loaded that oven everyday with those chickens!!!! They are DELICIOUS! After that I went to work on the front-end and then the Gas Station which was my FAVORITE job! I also helped out  as a door greeter the meat market Demos AND the seafood roadshows. I got around that store. Lol.

At my store its placed at the very back so you gotta go through the WHOLE store in order to buy it. Meaning you're more likely to buy something(s) else too before you get away with the chicken.

I'm thinking it has to do with what they are injecting it with.  I just recently started buying Kroger's 'baked chicken' (in Atlanta area). And holy cow, that stuff is like crack.

I used to do walmart and superstore (canada) and would spend about the same but by the next week we were already getting low. So id end up spending more in the long run, plus i live an hour from the city so time and money were spent getting more.

The cashier was shocked that I didn't buy anything else.  I just needed the chicken and I live 5 minutes away so no big deal to go in for just that.  My mom thinks they're the best but it was just OK.  They do make good soup if you use the carcass.  But for taste I actually like Walmart rotisserie better.

But, truth be known, our local Walmart marks down it's rotisserie chicken after it's sat under the warming bins for a few hours to $2.74 ! Yes, they take them and set them in the odd lots of cheese/meats from the deli section. Can't beat $2.74 for a rotisserie chicken that can feed a family of 4, even if it's cold."

Go to any of the major grocer chains and you'll usually get something that is over done and dry especially the breast meat.  Costco consistently keeps that area quite moist.  I think they're done in a brine vs everyone else that just throws seasonings on it.  Any Costco employee care to shed light in that?"

That family pack of wings is $ 10-12 now for about 4 lbs of uncut wings, you used to be able to get those for $ 3-4 for the family pack."

The only real upside is that your still getting your monies worth in bulk.  And the normal supermarket outlets are charging as or nearly as much with well over a third less product. Its still better to shop at costco's.    Their are other players in the field thats much cheaper and also have good product.  Aldi's and Trader Joes  offer great value."

An I'm increase of 5 bucks for the basic.  Now 60/year and 10 bucks for executive 120/year. Their beef comparison by pound is not a big of a deal. How many chickens do you need to buy to consider the 2 dollar savings by going to another store a real good deal. In a year you will need to buy 30 chickens just to break even, and then after that, you will start saving money. Also, other chains sells their beef at the same or lower price (similar quality) per pound and you don't have to buy it in bulk. By going to another store,  which name I won't mention,  I can buy the amount of meat I need and keep rotating it in my fridge.  I don't even have to freeze my meat.  It tastes more delicious.  I found myself eating frozen food from Costco for weeks on.  At the end,  it wasn't a good deal for my wallet or my belly.  I found myself eating more to avoid throwing out food before they get spoiled. "

They did all the raising, feeding, butchering, and cooking of the chicken. Even if you did use the chicken to get more chickens through breeding or get eggs through daily laying, it would still cost way more in terms of labor, time, and financial cost to raise and kill that chicken yourself than buy one from your local store. You could argue that it's shipping costs, but even then, refrigeration, transport, cooking, time, and labor costs seem heftier overall."

Unless you're lucky or go first thing when they open, a trip to Costco will take a long time. You'l be spending time sitting in traffic jams in the parking lot, finding a spot to park, walking from the boonies to the door, navigating the walls of people surrounding the samples so you can get to the back of the store for chicken and back to the registers, waiting in line to check out, waiting in line to show your receipt to get out, walking back ton your car (if you can actually where you parked), and finally navigating the traffic jams to get out. With all that, you'l be lucky to get in and out in under half an hour. "

""Gross margin"" - so maybe they earn less, but he didn't say they were actually losing money.
Which in a way makes this even sadder - those chicken can't have had a nice life if the journey from egg to rotisserie costs less than that.
If they could be treated better, paying a little more wouldn't be so bad, IMO."

Let's say it's been a slow day, and they pull the chickens that they don't want to sell to members any more, but are still good to eat. They flash chill the chickens, and then reuse the chicken for other items at Costco. You might find a tray of 6 drumsticks for $5, You might like our Chicken noodle soup, or our Chicken salad. also there are packages of just pure white meat chicken already cooked for you to use in a dish of your choosing. The only food that could be thrown out is when we make trays of chicken wings or ribs, which we normally save for the busier weekends. Sometimes the chickens are under the 3 pound weight and we'll even mark them down because of this. And that chicken farm she mentioned is only going to help Costco be able to sustain 40 percent of its supply chain. We are hoping that by doing this we can have a steadier supply of 3 pound chickens so we don't have to mark them down."

CostCo membership $60-120 a year. Walmart membership $0 a year. Most people don’t buy 60-120 baked chickens a year from those stores to make up the $1 difference. Walmart will have multiple stores in a city where there will only be 1 CostCo so Walmart will sell more baked chickens for $1 more and people won’t have to drive so far to save $1 on a baked chicken at CostCo.

The reason the cooked chicken is so cheap is because the uncooked chickens are very perishable. Instead of throwing the expired uncooked chicken out, they cook it - and give it a new expiration.  This is done with all sorts of meats.  They take various cuts of meat, throw some spices on it and some bell pepper and onions, and sell it as ""ready to cook meals"" with a new expiration date.  Many stores do this."

The key for the low cost chicken was glazed over by their clips. Costco's chicken farms raise chickens on cheap feed and soy. Soy is terrible for people, especially men. They don't get cheap chicken bc they invest more into them, they get cheap chickens bc they cheapen the chicken. That has a cause and effect on human health. But if your ok with that, it's cool,  just be in the know since this spin advertisement was meant to keep you ignorant."

These types of chickens are the ones that farmers keep in those dark warehouses. They eat whatever the farmers feed them like corn and they even eat their own shit and they walk around in their own shit.. They don't have even space to walk around and they just sit because they are fed horomones to make their breast and thighs bigger. They can't support their own weight so they just sit around. That's why the chicken meat is so soft it's because they are inactive.

It’s disgusting. They don’t look anything like they used to. These poor chickens are forced to grow in 6 weeks what they used to grow in 6 months. Their breast’s are so big and heavy that they can’t stand up. Their rib cages are almost flat. That’s torture! This is so WE can all “enjoy” a super cheap and easy meal without having to cook. Costco says they make no profit off these chickens so these little lives are only worth $4.99. It’s sick. I’m just as guilty because I know this and at time I cave in and buy one to make my own life easier. The guilt piles on as I start to see the bone structure of these poor animals. It’s so damn sad but who cares about stupid children’s, right? Well, we should ALL care!"

I can definitely understand where people are coming from. There was subtle chemical taste, which may not be noticed by most people. I also noticed that there was a part of the leg that was particularly strong in chemical taste. I read a comment somewhere that it was a cleaning chemical Costco used to disinfect rotating rods. I'm inclined to believe this. I think the part of the leg was wrapped around the rod and picked up more of the chemical flavor. If this is what's causing the issue, then it may be best to buy their chicken later in the day. I bought mine at 11 AM."

This taste is due to a disinfectant that is used to clean equipment and preparation surfaces, and I don't believe it is chlorine bleach. They wipe down surfaces with this stuff, whatever it is, then fail to rinse or wipe down with plain water. A soft-serve ice cream place that I once frequented made a batch without rinsing the cleaner out of the equipment. It was uneatable. I threw it away, and never went back. Some places like Taco Bell and pizza joints slide the food down the stainless steel counter, and the food picks-up the off taste if cleaning was improperly done.  Food service workers may have even been told they don't need to rinse after using this product. A quick look at food service disinfectants sold on Amazon show that they brag about not needing rinsing. Sure, if you don't mind your food tasting like disinfectant."

And at my two favorite Costco's I have not noted anything except great taste and the chickens are well above the 3 lb. minimum weight. Just a moment of science, chlorine water is regular water with chlorine gas infused (like at pools) a few hours after release of the water, the gas is released, and no chlorine is still there. Some friends that catered parties gave me the clew to soak my lettuce in the sink filled with water and a cap full of non-flavored bleach and the results were amazing. Give it a try, no Clorine smell."

The wife and I will eat half of it after bringing it home, while it's still hot.  We usually have a small salad along with it.  The other half we stretch over two more meals, one where we make sammies out of the meat, the other we'll toss into a dinner salad.  That's three meals for $5 - well, at least the main course part of it.  Altogether we probably spend about $15 max for those three meals."

But, I'd never leave Costco without buying 1 or 2 of them, one for that night and one I stick in the freezer for a quick meal later, (let the bashing begin).  Yes, it's not as good as buying it fresh buy if you've ever been in a pinch and hate fast food, a frozen Costco chicken defrosted in the fridge overnight still tastes better than some supermarket brands.  As far as the crispy skin, sure it's not crispy but, the kids still fight over it at the table and, if you've ever noticed, the one's in the supermarket that are actually labeled crispy rotisserie chicken are also the ones that are dry and overcooked AF.  Will definitely try making the stock with my next Costco carcass."

Not the heavy potato diet...they have relied on root vegetables for a long time due to their six month winters...alcoholism among men...they are not as fat as Americans, but heavy vodka drinking puts on weight.

It's an essential mineral/electrolyte required for blood pressure regulation.  Kidneys need it to regulate blood volume.  Any excess the kidneys will dump out with urine.  The recommendation of restricting sodium does more harm than good.  Problem is that people eat too much sugar and refined carbs.  Hyperinsulinemia activates angiotensin II rennin causes kidneys to increase blood pressure.  Electrolytes imbalance of magnesium and potassium will result in hypertension as well.  But it's much easier to blame sodium than address the real cause.

Is this just a Costco commercial?  They compare an entire Wendy's ""Baconator"", which is 8 oz of beef alone, plus bacon, cheese, and bread to a 3 oz piece of Chicken???  Who even eats a tiny 3 oz piece of Rotisserie Chicken.  Even if you are on a serious diet you're probably eating 4oz.  I assure you gram for gram, there is little difference in the sodium between this Costco chicken and the ""Baconator"".  I find Costco chickens to be kinda dry - HEB (in Texas) has a much better roasted bird, although smaller and more expensive."

I save the debris (skin, bones, and juice in the container) as the start for a chicken and sausage gumbo by placing it into a pot, adding enough water (or boxed chicken stock) to cover it and simmer for 30+ minutes.  Pour the debris and liquid through a fine mesh strainer, placed over a large measuring cup.  Discard the debris, let the liquid cool, cover, and place in the fridge for a few hours or overnight and the next day skim the fat from the top.  At this point I either freeze the liquid or add it to my roux, along with the reserved chicken meat and continue cooking my gumbo."

No no! Do not toss that remaining carcass.  Throw that into a pot with about 6+ cups of water (enough to cover), bring to a boil, and simmer for a few hours.

This will slow sales of homes in rural areas. It's going to be complicated for a while."

They quickly convinced me to never darken Home Depot's doorways again. They often sell identical items for much cheaper and their variety of goods is much better than at the nearby Home Depot. I can't tell you how many times, before Menards came to town, that I would find myself in the Home Depot parking lot ordering what I needed from Amazon because I had just walked out of Home Depot without finding what I was after.  Nowadays, so much of the Home Depot inventory is kept behind locked bars, if they actually have what you want, but you can't get an employee to unlock it, you can't buy it. Somehow Menards manages to do it without locking anything up. If Home Depot wants to make their future earnings targets, they better start remembering who their customers are. If Homer is looking for me, he can find me at Menards."

Xi Jinping’s cult of personality is leading to some serious consequences. What China really wants is advanced EUV lithography machines, which ASML will not sell to China. TSMC is their biggest partner. Setting up for the latest process node will be hard for any chip company to match TSMC even with the ASML’s machines. If China grabs TSMC then we will only have the likes of Samsung and Global Foundries, which would set the world back years. It’s also very likely that China would destroy much of TSMC’s capabilities in the process and be unable to utilize it for themselves."

Best piece of advice he gave was in the introduction. The rotisserie chicken is a loss leader at every grocery chain across the U S A. Try buying a fresh or frozen 4-5 lbs fryer and it 2-3 times more expensive. Most stores even pull the unsold cooked chickens after a certain time, decontruct snd sell it in the deli for more per pound as shredded chicken or make in house chicken salad."

Your video inspired me to cook just now. I made a similar version of your chicken cacciatore, along with some rotisserie taco meat, some chicken tikka masala, and bone broth with the carcass and scraps I accumulated along the way, all thanks to your video. I used 100% of my rotisserie chicken and made delicious meals for the week off one 5 dollar bird."

These sorts of videos go a long way to help someone (like me) who has decent cooking skills, but is only a recipe following. I don't have a good understanding of why I do what in a recipe, and how to change/add/remove things. These videos help a lot to get me to think outside the box more, and understand more of the why in cooking!"

They are delicious when they are done but ugh having to almost constantly be either boxing done ones, skewering the raw ones or doing dishes for them was not fun.  I very quickly asked the manager if I could transfer to produce haha"

But they used to take whatever didn't sell and make chicken salad out of it. It taste AMAZING. And is now the only way I will make chicken salad. According to my butcher, the chicken salad became so popular they make rotisserie chickens solely for it now all year round.  So if you ever have leftover rotisserie chicken, try it!"

That salad has given me so many ideas and I can't wait to try it. I despise store bought bleu cheese dressing and yours looks easy and like it will work. That chicken and biscuits... oh my. For some reason I've never been able to eat eggs and chicken together. It's a mental thing and I don't know where it came from. The dish still looked incredible and I may tweak it so I can eat it. Thank you for all the great ideas.

I don’t think rotisserie chicken is cheap where I live, but I can still buy a whole chicken and roast it myself. While the thighs taste great on their own, I’ve always struggled to eat the breasts because it’s so bland and meh. So I love the salad recipes you’ve shared and am super excited to try them out. It also works out healthy for my low—glycemic diet so thank you!"

- how to cook in the wild, all you have is stuff around you like stones, sharp stones, and other nature tools .... and ofcourse fresh ingredients from tree.
- challenge a Chef against their cooking instincts, like Frank making a dish with 0 salt and pepper, Penny with 0 Alcohol, Daniel but he is allowed 0 unorthodox ingredients etc.....
- Level 1 Chefs doing their proud speciality, and a level 3 Chef who has no experience with that dish.... kinda like a reverse (Swap Recipes) episode."

Chicken cheese crusted quesadilla. You can use extra Taco Bell sauce packets or whatever you like… toss your shredded chicken in some sauce (I typically use one packet of mild and one Hot per dilla.) add Mexican cheese and cook on medium. Once it’s almost finished, lift up the dilla and sprinkle some extra cheese in the pan and drop the dilla on top. Don’t touch it, just watch the edges and once it’s crisp shake it loose and repeat for the second side. "

That's what we kids did, we'd be shakin' bottles in the morning, so the dressing tasted best for dinner, the ""Slab Salad"" we did that with Ranch AND AVOCADO ( I was in Southern California we had Avocado trees in our yards).

A raw whole chicken IN THE SAME STORE is usually something like 40-50% more expensive. You can take one of these home, eat the bits you want and put the rest in the fridge. Throw the bones and scraps into the freezer to make broth (someday, when you've accumulated enough). Typically I eat the breast last because I'm a dark meat guy. Usually I make chicken salad sandwiches out of them or I just cube them up and eat them with rice or potatoes with hot sauce."

Being a Chef means you've spent years and years of experience from planning, costing, making meals, and working with other people; understanding the science of cooking methods and food nutrition, sanitation, safety, and efficiency when working in the kitchen, ethical procurement, sustainability, and proper usage of your ingredients, learning, preserving, and respecting the culture behind the dish that you make, and adapting to modern techniques like molecular gastronomy."

We get the Wal-mart type and it did go up from what it was before.  If we get them cold or not freshly cooked they mark them down to 3.99 or up.  Before fresh ones sold for 3.99 and when cold 1.50 it just depends on the expiration dates.  The fresher it is the more it cost :) enjoy from your fam in small town Ohio ^_^
